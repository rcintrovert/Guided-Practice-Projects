# Guided Project Completed from Udemy's The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp
Final project from this course was creating a clone of the database structure of a photo sharing social network like Instagram.
Note that some simplifications were made so it would be easier to follow along and the schema for the project is as followed.

The following business questions are answered using the database created:
1. We want to reward users who have been around the longest. Find the 5 oldest users.
2. What day of the week do most users register on? We need to figure out when to schedule an ad campaign.
3. We want to target our inactive users with an email campaign. Find the users who have never posted a photo.
4. We're running a new contest to see who can get the most likes on a single photo. Who won?
5. Investors want to know how many times does the average user post?
6. A brand wants to know which hashtags to use in a post. What are the top 5 most commonly used hashtags?
7. We have a small problem with bots on our site. Find the users who have liked every single photo on the site.
