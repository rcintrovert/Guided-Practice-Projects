This is for a fictional gym, MuscleHub, who wants to gain insights on their visitors. Their current system for onboarding new members from the visitors follow three steps. The first step is to take a fitness test with a personal trainer. Second, prospective member would fill out an application. Third, prospective member submits a payment for the first month. Janet, a manager from MuscleHub, thinks that a fitness test intimidates some prospective members, so she set up an A/B test. For a period of time, Janet collected data by randomly assigning visitors to one of two groups: Group A are those still asked to take a fitness test with a personal trainer and Group B who skips the fitness test. Janet's hypothesis is that visitors assigned to Group B will be more likely to eventually purchase a membership than visitors assigned to Group A. \n\n## Project Goals\n* Analyze the data from an A/B test with Python\n* Some of the questions that will be answered are the following\"\n1. Were there approximately the same number of visitors assigned to each group?\n1. Were the number of applications submitted affected by which group the visitor was assigned to?\n1. What would you recommend the MuscleHub do, keep the fitness test or get rid of it?\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data\n\nJanet of MuscleHub has a SQLite database, which contains several tables that will be helpful in this investigation.

Not everyone in the **visits.csv** file will have filled out an application.\n* *purchases* from the **purchases.csv** file, which contains information about customers who purchased a membership to MuscleHub.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Load data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for calculations\nimport seaborn as sns # for creating visualizations\n\n%matplotlib inline","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-19T01:08:59.195697Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-19T01:08:59.196134Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-19T01:08:59.202458Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-19T01:08:59.196099Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-19T01:08:59.201651Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":71,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import and read the csv files\napplications = pd.read_csv(\"../input/musclehub-abtest/applications.csv\")\nfitness_tests = pd.read_csv(\"../input/musclehub-abtest/fitness_tests.csv\")\npurchases = pd.read_csv(\"../input/musclehub-abtest/purchases.csv\")\nvisits = pd.read_csv(\"../input/musclehub-abtest/visits.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-19T01:09:06.493558Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-19T01:09:06.493972Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-19T01:09:06.522452Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-19T01:09:06.493938Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-19T01:09:06.521324Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":73,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# To preview the dataframe to see what data we are working with\nprint(\"applications :\")\napplications.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-18T21:44:47.151250Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-18T21:44:47.151673Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-18T21:44:47.165004Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-18T21:44:47.151638Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-18T21:44:47.163774Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"fitness_test :\")\nfitness_tests.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-18T21:45:02.754358Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-18T21:45:02.755095Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-18T21:45:02.768137Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-18T21:45:02.755054Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-18T21:45:02.767225Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"purchases :\")\npurchases.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-18T21:45:16.346720Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-18T21:45:16.347373Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-18T21:45:16.361194Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-18T21:45:16.347337Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-18T21:45:16.360353Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"visits :\")\nvisits.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-18T21:45:29.873201Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-18T21:45:29.873966Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-18T21:45:29.888180Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-18T21:45:29.873924Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-18T21:45:29.886474Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Process Data \n\nSince we have separate four separate DataFrames, we would need to combine it into a single DataFrame.
