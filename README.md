# Practice-Guided-Projects
Taking various online courses where there are some guided projects.
I will display them here.

## Guided Projects Completed from CodeAcademy to Practice Data Analysis 
### A/B Testing
* [MuscleHub A/B test](https://github.com/rcintrovert/Guided-Practice-Projects/blob/b5aabf6b8149e91ea834f350353483211196d00a/a-b-test-for-musclehub.ipynb)

  * Perfomed a Chi-Square test to determine if the categorical data for two independent variables have a relationship. 
### Page Funnel Analysis
This project had us analyzing the data from a fictional t-shirt e-commerce website. The data was provided in four separate csv files. Calculated the amount of visitors who did not make it to the cart, amount of visitors who placed an item in the cart, and amount of visitors who made it to checkout but did not purchase. Analyzing this data is important to determine what ways the company can improve the traffic to the site and ultimately gain more purchases. 
* [Page Visits Funnel Project](https://github.com/rcintrovert/Guided-Practice-Projects/blob/886ef11612e80c28aa327bac22e9d6ebf200be35/page_visits_funnel.ipynb)

* [Running some queries for the newly created database](https://github.com/rcintrovert/Guided-Practice-Projects/blob/13c3b01b16d6c25cecd918cd75e9962734c9aa10/MySQL%20Bootcamp%20Udemy/instagram_challenge.sql)
