# Practice-Guided-Projects
Taking various online courses where there are some guided projects.
I will display them here.

## Guided Projects Completed from CodeAcademy to Practice Data Analysis 
### A/B Testing
* [MuscleHub A/B test](https://github.com/rcintrovert/Guided-Practice-Projects/blob/b5aabf6b8149e91ea834f350353483211196d00a/a-b-test-for-musclehub.ipynb)
  * Onboarding procedure for the gym is tested in order to determine which method would help the business grow.
* [Shoefly.com A/B test](https://github.com/rcintrovert/Guided-Practice-Projects/blob/b5aabf6b8149e91ea834f350353483211196d00a/shoefly-com-a-b-testing.ipynb)
  * Tested which of the two ads performs better and the performance of the ad on different platforms.
* [Farmburg's A/B test](https://github.com/rcintrovert/Guided-Practice-Projects/blob/0e00850243459831b5dd7a6c63adc4ba814446a4/shoefly-com-a-b-testing.ipynb)
  * Perfomed a Chi-Square test to determine if the categorical data for two independent variables have a relationship. 
### [Page Funnel Analysis](https://github.com/rcintrovert/Guided-Practice-Projects/blob/886ef11612e80c28aa327bac22e9d6ebf200be35/page_visits_funnel.ipynb)

This project had us analyzing the data from a fictional t-shirt e-commerce website. The data was provided in four separate csv files. Calculated the amount of visitors who did not make it to the cart, amount of visitors who placed an item in the cart, and amount of visitors who made it to checkout but did not purchase. Analyzing this data is important to determine what ways the company can improve the traffic to the site and ultimately gain more purchases. 

### [Learning Python with U.S. Medical Insurance Cost](https://github.com/rcintrovert/Guided-Practice-Projects/blob/25b41bebf4d5f211bff2dc671304bbd5e0aba60e/python_medical_insurance.ipynb)

* Python Syntax: Suppose you are a medical professional curious about how certain factors contribute to medical insurance costs. Using a formula that estimates a person's yearly insurance costs, you will investigate how different factors such as age, sex, BMI, etc. affect the prediction.
* Python Strings: You are a doctor who needs to clean up medical patient records, which are currently stored in one large string. In this project, you will use your new knowledge of Python strings to obtain and clean up medical data so that it is easier to read and analyze.
* Python Lists: In this project, you will examine how factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status contribute to medical insurance costs. You will apply your new knowledge of Python Lists to store insurance cost data in a list as well as compare estimated insurance costs to actual insurance costs.
* Working with Python Lists: You are a doctor sorting through medical insurance cost data for some patients. Using your knowledge of Python lists, you will store medical data and see what valuable insights you can gain from that data.
* Python Dictionaries: You have been asked to create a program that organizes and updates medical records efficiently. In this project, you will use your new knowledge of Python dictionaries to create a database of medical records for patients.
* Python Loops: You are interested in analyzing medical insurance cost data efficiently without writing repetitive code. In this project, you will use your new knowledge of Python loops to iterate through and analyze medical insurance cost data.
* Python Classes: You have been asked to develop a system that makes it easier to organize patient data. You will create a class that does the following:
  * Takes in patient parameters regarding their personal information
  * Contains methods that allow users to update their information
  * Gives patients insight into their potential medical fees.
* Python Control Flow: In this project, you will examine how factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status contribute to medical insurance costs. You will apply your knowledge of Python control flow to write code that gives people advice on how to lower their medical insurance costs. In general, insurance costs are higher for smokers as well as people with a higher BMI. We can use the data from the variables smoker and bmi to provide advice on how to lower insurance costs.
### [Kiva Data Visualization with Python](https://github.com/rcintrovert/Guided-Practice-Projects/blob/5d0eb07eff662177f795ab193789aa1a49b5952b/kiva_project.ipynb)

The dataset contains information about loans awarded by the non-profit Kiva and the dataset is found on Kaggle. Using Seaborn, you'll explore the average loan amount by country using aggregated bar charts. You'll also visualize the distribution of loan amounts by project type and gender using box plots and violin plots.

### [EDA Diagnosing Diabetes](https://github.com/rcintrovert/Guided-Practice-Projects/blob/ce583be2cf8acfad38a410188fa2fbe231accb23/EDA%20Diagnosing%20Diabetes.ipynb)

In this project, you'll imagine you are a data scientist interested in exploring data that looks at how certain diagnostic factors affect the diabetes outcome of women patients. You will use your EDA skills to help inspect, clean, and validate the data.

### [EDA FoodWheel](https://github.com/rcintrovert/Guided-Practice-Projects/blob/03ea876b931b1f586d78c7ccee44336c14f773e0/foodwheel_project.ipynb)

FoodWheel is a startup delivery service that takes away the struggle of deciding where to eat! FoodWheel picks you an amazing local restaurant and lets you order through the app. Senior leadership is getting ready for a big board meeting, and as the resident Data Analyst, you have been enlisted to help decipher data and answer some key questions:
* What cuisines does FoodWheel offer? 
* Which areas should the company search for more restaurants to partner with?
* How has the average order amount changed over time?
* What does this say about the trajectory of the company?
* How much has each customer on FoodWheel spent over the past six months? 
* What can this tell us about the average FoodWheel customer?

## Guided Project Completed from Udemy's The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp
Final project from this course was creating a clone of the database structure of a photo sharing social network like Instagram.
* [Creating the database](https://github.com/rcintrovert/Guided-Practice-Projects/blob/13c3b01b16d6c25cecd918cd75e9962734c9aa10/MySQL%20Bootcamp%20Udemy/ig_clone_data.sql)
* [Running some queries for the newly created database](https://github.com/rcintrovert/Guided-Practice-Projects/blob/13c3b01b16d6c25cecd918cd75e9962734c9aa10/MySQL%20Bootcamp%20Udemy/instagram_challenge.sql)
